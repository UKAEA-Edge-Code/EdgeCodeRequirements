## Overview

Description from the [jax GitHub readme page](https://github.com/google/jax):

> "JAX is a Python library for accelerator-oriented array computation and program transformation, designed for high-performance numerical computing and large-scale machine learning. ...JAX can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy functions... It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation) via grad as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily to any order...JAX uses XLA to compile and run your NumPy programs on GPUs and TPUs ... with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and executed. BJAX also lets you just-in-time compile your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels using a one-function API, jit."
