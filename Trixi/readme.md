# Trixi

## Overview

Description from the [Trixi project page](https://trixi-framework.github.io/Trixi.jl/stable/overview/):

> "Trixi.jl is designed as a library of components for discretizations of
> hyperbolic conservation laws. Trixi.jl uses the method of lines, i.e., the
> full space-time discretization is separated into two steps; the spatial
> semidiscretization is performed at first and the resulting ODE system is
> solved numerically using a suitable time integration method. "

## Notes

- Visualisation with Plots.jl, Makie.jl ("experimental") and Paraview, via Trixi2Vtk.
